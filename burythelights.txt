I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed, my family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ashes are divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time

Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
Can't run away
Keep walking the line, between thе light
Led astray
Through vacant halls I won't surrender
Thе truth revealed in nights of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost and now they remember

I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed, my family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ashes are divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time
